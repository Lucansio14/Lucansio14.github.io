         <h2>About me</h2>
         <p style="color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Schoolbook'; font-size: 20.4px; background-color:#0c0301">
         Hello! I am Lucas (or, if you prefer, Luke), a Spanish physicist from Majorca with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in Physics and a Master’s degree in Advanced Physics and Applied Mathematics from the Universitat de les Illes Balears (UIB). I specialize in mathematics, programming, and research applied to plasma and solar physics (especially, magnetohydrodynamics). Specifically, I tend to be interested in astrophysics and anything related to solar physics, Python programming, numerical simulations, numerical solutions of equations, data analysis and management, and continuous training. This comes as a result of always having a profound fascination for outer space, which has constantly manifested in a deep eagerness to discover more about the cosmos, especially celestial bodies such as the Sun.
         <br> <br> 
         I would describe myself as a hard-working, kind, and diligent individual, who always seeks to push through hardships with dedication, continuously learning from my mistakes to accomplish my goals with passion and motivation. Even if sometimes this attitude can demand too much of me, and overwhelm me, I always strive to overcome adversity and find success with perseverance, effort and teamwork. At the moment, I am seeking to become a PhD student to train in the research sector in any area slightly related to my interests.
